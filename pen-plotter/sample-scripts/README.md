# Sample scripts

These sample scripts are made to work with the pen-plotter available at CoLAB at HAW Hamburg. Please refer to [these slides](https://haw-type-design.github.io/newpage-x-y/pen-plotter) for basics and setup. Youâ€™ll need the AxiDrawCLI installed before running the scripts in you command line. 

## draw2plot

Draw to plot was written to showcase the plotter at the Rundgang Finkenau 2023. It uses `tkinter` as the interface to draw on the screen and cosecutively plot the dessin on the connected plotter. The code is commented for better understanding.
